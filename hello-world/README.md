$ docker run hello-world
    Hello from Docker.
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    
    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
     1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
     2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
        (Assuming it was not already locally available.)
     3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
        executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
     4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
        to your terminal.
    
    To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
     $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

# Issues and Contributing

If you have any questions about the image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/issues) or in the IRC channel `#docker-library` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).

If you want to contribute, we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/hello-world/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
