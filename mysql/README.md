# MySQL
MySQL is (as of March 2014) the world's second most widely used open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It is named after co-founder Michael Widenius's daughter, My. The SQL phrase stands for Structured Query Language.

MySQL is a popular choice of database for use in web applications, and is a central component of the widely used LAMP open source web application software stack (and other 'AMP' stacks). LAMP is an acronym for "Linux, Apache, MySQL, Perl/PHP/Python." Free-software-open source projects that require a full-featured database management system often use MySQL.

# How to use this image

## start a mysql instance
    docker run --name some-mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -d mysql

This image includes `EXPOSE 3306` (the mysql port), so standard container linking will make it automatically available to the linked containers (as the following examples illustrate).

## connect to it from an application
    docker run --name some-app --link some-mysql:mysql -d application-that-uses-mysql

## ... or via `mysql`
    docker run -it --link some-mysql:mysql --rm mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -h"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_ADDR" -P"$MYSQL_PORT_3306_TCP_PORT" -uroot -p"$MYSQL_ENV_MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"'

# Issues and Contributing

If you have any questions about the image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues) or in the IRC channel `#docker-library` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).

If you want to contribute, we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/mysql/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
