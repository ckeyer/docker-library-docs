# How to use this image

    docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -d wordpress

The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your WordPress instance:

 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked mysql container)
 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "wordpress")
 - `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT=...` (default to unique random SHA1s)

If the `WORDPRESS_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist in the given MySQL container,  it will be created automatically upon container startup, provided that the `WORDPRESS_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

    docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d wordpress

Then, access it via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.
