# How to use this image

    docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -d wordpress

The following environment variables are also honored for configuring your WordPress instance:

 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_USER=...` (defaults to "root")
 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_PASSWORD=...` (defaults to the value of the `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` environment variable from the linked mysql container)
 - `-e WORDPRESS_DB_NAME=...` (defaults to "wordpress")
 - `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_KEY=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_SECURE_AUTH_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_LOGGED_IN_SALT=...`, `-e WORDPRESS_NONCE_SALT=...` (default to unique random SHA1s)

If the `WORDPRESS_DB_NAME` specified does not already exist in the given MySQL container,  it will be created automatically upon container startup, provided that the `WORDPRESS_DB_USER` specified has the necessary permissions to create it.

If you'd like to be able to access the instance from the host without the container's IP, standard port mappings can be used:

    docker run --name some-wordpress --link some-mysql:mysql -p 8080:80 -d wordpress

Then, access it via `http://localhost:8080` or `http://host-ip:8080` in a browser.

# Issues and Contributing

If you have any questions about the image, please contact us through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/issues) or in the IRC channel `#docker-library` on [Freenode](https://freenode.net).

If you want to contribute, we are always thrilled to receive pull requests, and do our best to process them as fast as possible. Not sure if that typo is worth a pull request? Do it! We will appreciate it.

If your pull request is not accepted on the first try, don't be discouraged! If there's a problem with the implementation, hopefully you received feedback on what to improve.

We recommend discussing your plans through a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/docker-library/wordpress/issues) before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions. This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone else is working on the same thing.

Any significant improvement should be documented as a GitHub issue before anybody starts working on it. Please take a moment to check that an issue doesn't already exist documenting your bug report or improvement proposal. If it does, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This will help prioritize the most common problems and requests.
